	help
	  Device driver initialization priority.

config NORDIC_QSPI_NOR_FLASH_LAYOUT_PAGE_SIZE
	int "Page size to use for FLASH_LAYOUT feature"
	default 65536
	help
	  When CONFIG_FLASH_PAGE_LAYOUT is used this driver will support
	  that API.  By default the page size corresponds to the block
	  size (65536).  Other option include the sector size (4096).

config NORDIC_QSPI_NOR_STACK_WRITE_BUFFER_SIZE
	int "Size of a stack-based buffer to support writes from NVMC"
	default 0
	help
	  The QSPI peripheral uses DMA and cannot write data that is
	  read from the internal flash.  A non-zero value here enables
	  a stack buffer into which data is copied to allow the write
	  to proceed.  Multiple transfers will be initiated if the
	  data is larger than the configured limit.  Must be a
	  multiple of 4.  The feature is disabled when set to 0.

config LCZ_NRF_QSPI_NOR_COOL_DOWN_PERIOD
	int "The number of milliseconds to wait before shutting the QSPI down"
	default 10000
	help
	  The QSPI consumes current when idling with the default driver not
	  supporting any means of switching it off. This time determines when
	  sufficient inactivity has occurred to allow the QSPI to shut down.
